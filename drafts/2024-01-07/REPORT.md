# Cards that did well

>>> <<[[!Oust]][[!Ephara's Dispersal]][[!Unearth]][[!Mesmeric Fiend]]>> <<<

- I already knew I liked [[Oust]], but this draft further solidified that. Casting it on your own creatures for a bit of life gain is a fun play pattern, and the fact that it's 1 mana is key for cards like [[Dreadhorde Arcanist]]. Sorcery speed means additional decisions forced on the caster, which in my opinion is a good thing overall.

- [[Ephara's Dispersal]] did well, providing good tempo advantage. The _surveil_ is great late-game if you want to clear lands from the top of your deck, even if you don't have any more explicit graveyard synergies going on. It only gets better with cards like [[Tarmogoyf]].

- [[Unearth]] is a card I already knew I liked. Just wanted to call it out here because its modality provides really fun decisions. Unearthing [[Snapcaster Mage]] and then casting [[Unearth]] again is very cool. So is cycling it with [[Archfiend of Ifnir]] in play.

- [[Mesmeric Fiend]] finally saw decent action and I think was great. I was thinking of doing a swap for [[Kitesail Freebooter]], but there might be room for both actually.

>>> <<[[!Raven's Crime]][[!Inti, Seneschal of the Sun]][[!Malfegor]][[!Halo Forager]]>> <<<

- [[Raven's Crime]] is cheap, recurrable, and annoying to play against. You can't feel too bad about it though because you get to decide what to discard. It got more than one cast in a game a couple of times this draft.

- [[Initi, Seneschal of the Sun]] finally saw real play, and did as well as expected. Discarding [[Oust]] to buff a creature, and then flashing it back with [[Snapcaster Mage]] is a great play. Especially when [[Dragon's Rage Channeler]] is sitting top-deck for you to cast.

- [[Malfegor]] saw action after a long period of none. He won a game at the wire. Yes, he's got a tough casting cost - but a 6/6 flier with upside is actually good in this cube.

- [[Halo Forager]] is _sometimes_ even better than [[Snapcaster Mage]]. A 3/1 flier is great, and it can target your opponent's graveyard - providing potentially a lot more options.

>>> <<[[!Remand]][[!Sparring Construct]][[!Throne of the God-Pharoh]]>> <<<

- [[Remand]], [[Memory Lapse]], [[Reprieve]], and [[Delay]] all worked wonders this round. Each plays differently, but the tempo advantage is real and that's the sort of environment I want. It would be a problem if a turn or two of tempo gained at the right moment wasn't impactful.

- [[Sparring Construct]] continues to over perform my expectations. It's freeing to willingly chump block in order to get a counter, or force a difficult blocking decision for your opponent. Very similar to [[Perilous Myr]] in that regard.

- [[Throne of the God-Pharoh]] is especially good in an aggro deck, but brings surprising value with even just a small handful of creatures.

# Cards to monitor

>>> <<[[!Fatestitcher]][[!Magma Phoenix]][[!Jace, Arcane Strategist]]>> <<<

These cards all fall into a category of "priced out" - they are a bit too expensive for what they bring to the table at this point.

>>> <<[[!Hostage Taker]]>> <<<

- [[Hostage Taker]] is really powerful. One thing I like is the tension about when to cast [[Hostage Taker]] - can you make it another turn before it's removed or do you need to steal something cheaper that you can play right away? I want to let him play out a bit more to see what sorts of counter-play show up. I can imagine things like flicker, counterspells, instant-speed removal all work well here.

# General notes

- Lands were much more tightly contested this time around, likely due to the success of decks with higher fixing in the last draft. This just reinforces my suspicion that doubling up on fetches will be a great improvement.

- Fight spells are confusing when one of the targets is removed in response - I still don't quite have the rules internalized. They are also a good way to 2-for-1 yourself. Despite reading about this many times, I've finally witnessed it in a way that makes me need to reconsider fight a bit. Nothing major, but might want to think about alternatives to cards like [[Tail Swipe]].

- The +1/+1 counter deck managed to make some pretty big creatures, but was missing a bit of reach. I think this could definitely be mitigated with the current set by adding more white fliers, but I also noticed that we're missing tools to give creatures temporary trample. I've got my eye on a few cards to improve this. [[The Huntsman's Redemption]] is very cool. I love the flavor, I love that it touches on tokens, sacrifice, enchantments, and just general midrange aggression. It will help with _delirium_ and similar strategies as well, and also gives creatures trample (and gives your opponent some time to prep). Also considering [[Rile]] as a cheap cantriping trample enabler.

- Love that [[Virtue of Persistence]] forecasts itself to your opponent. It's really powerful, but gives your opponent a chance to dig for or save enchantment removal to prepare.

- The "discard matters" deck didn't come together in its best form this draft, so it's hard to draw too many conclusions. One thing that I think I can conclude is that it could use a bit more in the way of relevant early-game play. Cards like [[Ruthless Sniper]] and [[Bitter Triumph]] will fill these holes well, as will [[Blazing Rootwalla]] and other cheap madness cards. I still have faith in [[Malfegor]].

# Cards to consider

- [[The Huntsman's Redemption]]
- [[Rile]]
- [[Ruthless Sniper]]
