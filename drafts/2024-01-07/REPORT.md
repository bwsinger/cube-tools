# Cards that did well

>>> <<[[!Oust]][[!Ephara's Dispersal]][[!Unearth]]>> <<<

- I already knew I liked [[Oust]], but this draft further solidified that. Casting it on your own creatures for a bit of life gain is a fun play pattern, and the fact that it's 1 mana is key for cards like [[Dreadhorde Arcanist]]. Sorcery speed means additional decisions forced on the caster, which in my opinion is a good thing overall.

- [[Ephara's Dispersal]] did well, providing good tempo advantage. The _surveil_ is great late-game if you want to clear lands from the top of your deck, even if you don't have any more explicit graveyard synergies going on. It only gets better with cards like [[Tarmogoyf]].

- [[Unearth]] is a card I already knew I liked. Just wanted to call it out here because its modality provides really fun decisions. Unearthing [[Snapcaster Mage]] and then casting [[Unearth]] again is very cool. So is cycling it with [[Archfiend of Ifnir]] in play.

# Cards to monitor


# General notes

- Lands were much more tightly contested this time around, likely due to the success of decks with higher fixing in the last draft. This just reinforces my suspicion that doubling up on fetches will be a great improvement.

- Fight spells are confusing when one of the targets is removed in response - I still don't quite have the rules internalized. They are also a good way to 2-for-1 yourself. Despite reading about this many times, I've finally witnessed it in a way that makes me need to reconsider fight a bit. Nothing major, but might want to think about alternatives to cards like [[Tail Swipe]].

- The +1/+1 counter deck managed to make some pretty big creatures, but was missing a bit of reach. I think this could definitely be mitigated with the current set by adding more white fliers, but I also noticed that we're missing tools to give creatures temporary trample. I've got my eye on a few cards to improve this. [[The Huntsman's Redemption]] is very cool. I love the flavor, I love that it touches on tokens, sacrifice, enchantments, and just general midrange aggression. It will help with _delirium_ and similar strategies as well, and also gives creatures trample (and gives your opponent some time to prep). Also considering [[Rile]] as a cheap cantriping trample enabler.

- Love that [[Virtue of Persistence]] forecasts itself to your opponent. It's really powerful, but gives your opponent a chance to dig for or save enchantment removal to prepare.
