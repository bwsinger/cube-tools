# Food

Food deck was signposted by [[Greta, Sweettooth Scourge]]. However, there wasn't quite enough food available to make it a complete deck.

Despite that slight lack of _food_ density, in a matchup against my lands/retrace deck, the Food deck saw success
using [[Virtue of Persistence]] to reanimate food producers to recursively generate tokens, then sacrifice them
in conjunction with [[Sanguine Bond]] to drain the opponent.

In the matchup against the RW aggro deck, it took a bit too long for the Food deck to stabilize the board and the aggro deck was able to
outpace the food deck for a win. Need more data on this one - on the one hand, I want aggro decks to perform like this in order to
keep greedier decks in check. I do need to consider whether there are enough counter-play options available for the food deck though.

# Lands

Two versions of a lands deck appeared in this draft.

I made a BRG lands-in-the-graveyard deck based around [[Worm Harvest]], [[Life from the Loam]], [[Orcish Lumberjack]] primarily.
- This deck was a bit slow to get started against the Food deck, but managed to get the engine running quick enough to seriously threaten a win by dredging [[Life of the Loam]]
and milling [[Worm Harvest]] and a couple of lands into the graveyard in one swoop. However, the Foods stabilized in the late game
with [[Virtue of Persistence]] and eeked out a nail-biting win with 4 life left.
- In my matchup with the WUR aggro/control goodstuff deck, I again got off to a decent start but [[Welcoming Vampire]] was too
strong of a card advantage engine for me to overcome and it resulted in a [[Dream Trawler]] smashing my face in before I could finish the game.

There was also a WUG land sacrifice deck built around [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]], [[Knight of the Reliquary]], and [[Fall of the Thran]]. This felt
more of a control deck with a multi-card finisher. In the aggro matchup, it was on the back foot the whole game but had sufficient answers to the threats
presented that it was able to win on the very last turn with 0 cards remaining in the deck! It relied on several pieces of white removal and [[Lion Sash]]
to eat away graveyards and swing for big damage just before being milled. [[Restless Vinestalk]] also proved a valuable game piece in this matchup.

# Other notes / summary

- Drafters continue to get really strong red/blue spells-matter signals throughout the draft. Might want to tone those down a tiny bit.
- [[Lion Sash]] has yet again proved its ability to take over games.
- The RG flashback / retrace / recursive play from graveyard style decks might be missing one or two on-board threats that can come back
  from the graveyard. Most of the cards I managed to find this draft were spells (e.g., [[Raven's Crime]]).

# Changes to consider

- [[Call of the Herd]] as another great green option with flashback.
- [[Wrenn and Six]] is just a perfect fit for the lands theme in this cube. Is he too powerful?
- [[Tough Cookie]] would really bolster the Food and artifact animation themes.
- [[Elvish Reclaimer]] might help make the retrace deck more aggressive.
- [[Grim Flayer]] is another option for the graveyard-matters theme.
