# Food

Food deck was signposted by [[Greta, Sweettooth Scourge]]. However, there wasn't quite enough food available to make it a complete deck.

In a matchup against my lands/retrace deck, the Food deck saw success using [[Virtue of Persistence]] to reanimate food producers
to generate tokens, then sacrifice them in conjunction with [[Sanguine Bond]] to drain the opponent.

In the matchup against the RW aggro deck, it took a bit too long for the Food deck to stabilize the board and the aggro deck was able to
outpace the food deck for a win.

# Lands

Two versions of a lands deck appeared in this draft.

I made a BRG lands-in-the-graveyard deck based around [[Worm Harvest]], [[Life from the Loam]], [[Orcish Lumberjack]] primarily. This deck was a bit
slow to get started against the Food deck, but managed to get the engine running quick enough to seriously threaten a win by dredging [[Life of the Loam]]
and milling [[Worm Harvest]] and a couple of lands into the graveyard in one swoop. However, the Foods stabilized in the late game
with [[Virtue of Persistence]] and eeked out a nail-biting win with 4 life left.

There was also a WUG land sacrifice deck built around [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]], [[Knight of the Reliquary]], and [[Fall of the Thran]]. This felt
more of a control deck with a multi-card finisher. In the aggro matchup, it was on the backfoot the whole game but had sufficient answers to the threats
presented that it was able to win on the very last turn with 0 cards remaining in the deck. It relied on several pieces of white removal and [[Lion Sash]]
to eat away graveyards and swing for big damage before being milled.

# +1/+1 counters

# Other notes / summary

- Drafters continue to get really strong red/blue spells-matter signals throughout the draft. Might want to tone those down a tiny bit.
- [[Lion Sash]] has yet again proved its ability to take over games.

# Changes to consider

- [[Call of the Herd]] as another great green option with flashback.
