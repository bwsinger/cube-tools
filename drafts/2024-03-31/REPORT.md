# Notes

## Titania

[[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] is now a beast. With double fetches, she's an easy first pick and it's not hard to build a strong deck around her. I think it's time to think about some counter-play for her, which I think can come in a couple of forms:

- Graveyard hate. The ability to get rid of those pesky fetches from the graveyard means it's harder for Titania to get instant value.
- A bit more targeted creature removal across the board. I think I could easily support up to 10 more removal spells in the cube, but may start with fewer.

## Tectonic Reformation

This was a new addition this draft, and I think it performed OK. It's a bit slow for an aggro deck, but it does manage to accrue a LOT of value if your mana curve is sufficiently low. I managed to cycle 5 lands on it easily some games, which kept my aggressive deck fed with threats. I think this one still needs some time to soak though before I decide if it's a good fit.

## Many, many, tokens

There are some pretty insane plays that can be made regarding tokens. This time, I was lucky enough to witness a [[Chandra, Hope's Beacon]] helping pay for a [[Parallel Lives]] --> [[Empty the Warrens]] and it was glorious. A bit more of a swingy play than I really want to run rampant in this cube, but also pretty cool that it might happen sometimes.

## Wilderness Reclamation

This card proved to be fairly useful even in a deck with a limited number of instant speed options. I still think this really requires a harder build around to really shine, but it was very cool seeing it come out with [[Vivien, Champion of the Wilds]]. Neither of these cards get picked often, but I still really like them for the way they can totally change your game plan.
