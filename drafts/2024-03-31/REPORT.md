# Notes

## Win Conditions

Here are the primary win conditions I saw from decks in this draft:

{w}

- [[Cloudgoat Ranger]]
- [[Fearless Fledgling]]
- [[Lion Sash]]

{u}

- [[Thing in the Ice]]
- [[Curator of Mysteries]]

{b}

- [[Virtue of Persistence]]
- [[Puppeteer Clique]]
- [[Liliana, Death's Majesty]]
- [[Archfiend of Ifnir]]

{r}

- [[Krenko, Tin Street Kingpin]]
- [[Goblin Bombardment]]
- [[Mayhem Devil]]
- [[Empty the Warrens]]
- [[Comet Storm]]

{g}

- [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]]
- [[Gruff Triplets]]
- [[Worm Harvest]]
- [[Scavenging Ooze]]
- [[Multani, Yavimaya's Avatar]]

There are also a number of cards acting as strong enablers in these decks:

- [[Wilderness Reclamation]]
- [[Parallel Lives]]
- [[Marshal's Anthem]]

## Titania

[[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] is now a beast. With double fetches, she's an easy first pick and it's not too hard to build a strong deck around her. I think it's time to think about some counter-play, which I think can come in a couple of forms:

- Graveyard hate. The ability to get rid of those pesky fetches from the graveyard means it's harder for Titania to get instant value.
- A bit more targeted creature removal across the board. I think I could easily support up to 10 more removal spells in the cube, but may start with fewer.
- Perhaps even remove a few of the extra land sac outlets that were originally added before 2x fetches.

I've already added some graveyard hate, and there are a couple more pieces coming in soon.

Something like [[Engineered Explosives]] is also a very powerful answer to the tokens Titania creates.

## [[Tectonic Reformation]]

This was a new addition this draft, and I think it performed OK. It's a bit slow for an aggro deck, but it does manage to accrue a LOT of value if your mana curve is sufficiently low. I managed to cycle 5 lands on it easily some games, which kept my aggressive deck fed with threats. I think this one still needs some time to soak though before I decide if it's a good fit. There were definitely times I felt I'd rather not have drawn it, even with the _cycling_ mode on it.

## Many, many, tokens

There are some pretty insane plays that can be made regarding tokens. This time, I was lucky enough to witness a [[Chandra, Hope's Beacon]] helping pay for a [[Parallel Lives]] --> [[Empty the Warrens]] and it was glorious. A bit more of a swingy play than I really want to run rampant in this cube, but also pretty cool that it might happen sometimes. It does feel a little bit like [[Parallel Lives]] doesn't fit the mold of the rest of the cube, but maybe that's an OK thing. This is one to keep an eye on though - if it turns out there are no real ways to interact with this strategy then it will need tuning. I mentioned it earlier, but [[Engineered Explosives]] seems like a slam dunk option for interacting with these strategies.

## [[Wilderness Reclamation]]

This card proved to be fairly useful even in a deck with a limited number of instant speed options. I still think this really requires a harder build around to really shine, but it was very cool seeing it come out with [[Vivien, Champion of the Wilds]]. Neither of these cards get picked often, but I still really like them for the way they can totally change your game plan.

## [[Courser of Kruphix]]

[[Courser of Kruphix]] was, as expected, pretty hard to deal with. Four toughness is a hard barrier to cross in this cube, as there aren't a lot of things that will trade in combat and it outlives most burn spells as well. This card is an aggro killer. [[Auger of Autumn]] might be a better option here, especially now that I've chopped [[Setessan Champion]] for being too narrow.

## [[Gruff Triplets]]

Such a swingy card, still. I had said several drafts ago that I was going to replace this one, and I still think I will. The problem with [[Gruff Triplets]] is that he's a win-in-a-can. You can go from no board presence, 5 life, to winning in two turns with very little that can be done about it unless your opponent has the perfect hand (board wipe, or several bounce / flicker spells and a removal spell). I have my eyes on [[Esika's Chariot]] as one potential replacement. I think my green finishers need to have some value in the face of removal, but [[Gruff Triplets]] goes too far.

## [[Domri, Anarch of Bolas]]

I really enjoy Domri as a planeswalker that doesn't build infinite value, and that doesn't have an ultimate "Win the game" button at the end. He does very relevant things - ramp, mana fixing, an anthem, and removal. The only issue I take with him is the uncounterability. I won't argue that this isn't powerful, or isn't relevant. However, I think it comes with a gameplay problem of negating large swaths of the cube's interaction. This is one to keep an eye on - I really wish he just didn't have that clause. There are other planeswalkers who meet this criteria - [[Wrenn and Six]] in particular is even in the same colors. I think Domri is probably OK so long as I continue to keep the number of nonland permanent bounce spells in blue high, as they at least give a way to deal with it in a color that otherwise is creature-light (so can't attack planeswalkers easily) and relies on counterspells for interaction.

## [[Blazing Rootwalla]]

Is just a little guy, but even in his first draft he's shown himself capable of being a real pain. The threat of activation is real, and I've seen him actually get cast using his _madness_ cost a few times already. I think he fits in nicely.

## {u}{w} control

Feels like this deck is just a step behind where it needs to be. Have seen it in a few drafts now. I think there are three main issues here:

- White's removal is either expensive (e.g., [[Oblivion Ring]]), sorcery speed (e.g., [[Oblivion Ring]]), or can be dealt with (e.g., [[Oblivion Ring]]). This deck probably wants cheaper, instant speed removal.
- The win conditions available for it are a bit underwhelming.
    - [[Thing in the Ice]] is great, but of course requires building around and doesn't trigger off [[Oblivion Ring]] variants. You really want to load up on instants and sorceries here.
    - [[Curator of Mysteries]] is solid, and probably not going anywhere, but is also a bit underwhelming as a payoff for being on the back foot all game.
    - [[Angel of Salvation]] is expensive and relies on creatures being on the field in order to reduce the cost. I think she's great, but not meant for this deck.
    - [[Sphinx of Lost Truths]] is less of a win condition and more of a body attached to a mediocre dig spell.
- It's hard to turn the corner. Right now, it relies almost entirely on a board wipe of some kind. Otherwise, it's just landing and sticking a finisher, but as discussed those are a bit sad at the moment.

I've already made a few changes that will boost this one.

- [[Gitaxian Probe]] goes in any deck, but I think will do especially well as a free [[Thing in the Ice]] trigger that also provides hand information.
- New white removal spells - [[Elspeth's Smite]], [[Soul Parition]], and [[Unexpectedly Absent]] are all new instant speed options in white.
- [[Monastery Mentor]] comes in as a new flavor of win condition that's a bit more aggressive.
- [[Mystic Sanctuary]] to pull back a bounce spell or counterspell for free proved very valuable in testing.

I have a few other things up my sleeve for a potential future update:

- [[Ethereal Forager]] was fun in testing and can provide a lot of card advantage. It's vulnerable, but can be protected with counterspells, etc., for a good time.
- [[Mystic Confluence]] is perhaps too strong, but is also on my watch list as a card that will help this deck "turn the corner" so to speak, and just generally draw folks into blue (another problem I am fighting with).
- [[Shark Typhoon]] is a modal win condition that can be played at just about any point of the game, meaning you have more flexibility in deciding when it is time to "turn the corner".
- [[Soul Snare]] is another removal option for this deck. Perhaps less good since it's still enchantment based, but plays nicely with [[Tameshi, Reality Architect]]. And the fact that it's only {w} to cast means it's hard to lose tempo on this one.
- [[Vendilion Clique]] is another one that might be too strong, but provides a more proactive slant.
- [[Celestial Colonnade]] is another classic win condition that's hard to interact with.

I think all of these together would supercharge this deck, so I'm going to hold off to see how the changes I've already made perform before deciding what else is needed.

## [[Duress]]

My usual group hasn't really bit on this card too much in the past, but it did some real work this time around. Even the fail case of simply viewing your opponent's hand is pretty solid, and there are a lot of non-creature, non-land threats that need to be dealt with. It always provided value and interesting decisions, and reinforced my confidence in the amount of hand interaction I've added in recent updates.
