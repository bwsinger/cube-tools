# Notes

## Win Conditions

Here are the primary win conditions I saw from decks in this draft:

{w}

- [[Cloudgoat Ranger]]
- [[Fearless Fledgling]]
- [[Lion Sash]]

{u}

- [[Thing in the Ice]]
- [[Curator of Mysteries]]

{b}

- [[Virtue of Persistence]]
- [[Puppeteer Clique]]
- [[Liliana, Death's Majesty]]
- [[Archfiend of Ifnir]]

{r}

- [[Krenko, Tin Street Kingpin]]
- [[Goblin Bombardment]]
- [[Mayhem Devil]]
- [[Empty the Warrens]]
- [[Comet Storm]]

{g}

- [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]]
- [[Gruff Triplets]]
- [[Worm Harvest]]
- [[Scavenging Ooze]]
- [[Multani, Yavimaya's Avatar]]

There are also a number of cards acting as strong enablers in these decks:

- [[Wilderness Reclamation]]
- [[Parallel Lives]]
- [[Marshal's Anthem]]

## Titania

[[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] is now a beast. With double fetches, she's an easy first pick and it's not hard to build a strong deck around her. I think it's time to think about some counter-play for her, which I think can come in a couple of forms:

- Graveyard hate. The ability to get rid of those pesky fetches from the graveyard means it's harder for Titania to get instant value.
- A bit more targeted creature removal across the board. I think I could easily support up to 10 more removal spells in the cube, but may start with fewer.
- Perhaps even remove a few of the extra land sac outlets that were originally added before 2x fetches.

I've already added some graveyard hate, and there are a couple more pieces coming in soon. Most importantly, [[Scrabbling Claws]].

Something like [[Engineered Explosives]] is also a very powerful answer to the tokens Titania creates.

## Tectonic Reformation

This was a new addition this draft, and I think it performed OK. It's a bit slow for an aggro deck, but it does manage to accrue a LOT of value if your mana curve is sufficiently low. I managed to cycle 5 lands on it easily some games, which kept my aggressive deck fed with threats. I think this one still needs some time to soak though before I decide if it's a good fit. There were definitely times I felt I'd rather not have drawn it, even with the _cycling_ mode on it.

## Many, many, tokens

There are some pretty insane plays that can be made regarding tokens. This time, I was lucky enough to witness a [[Chandra, Hope's Beacon]] helping pay for a [[Parallel Lives]] --> [[Empty the Warrens]] and it was glorious. A bit more of a swingy play than I really want to run rampant in this cube, but also pretty cool that it might happen sometimes. It does feel a little bit like [[Parallel Lives]] doesn't fit the mold of the rest of the cube, but maybe that's an OK thing. This is one to keep an eye on though - if it turns out there are no real ways to interact with this strategy then it will need tuning. I mentioned it earlier, but [[Engineered Explosives]] seems like a slam dunk option for interacting with these strategies.

## Wilderness Reclamation

This card proved to be fairly useful even in a deck with a limited number of instant speed options. I still think this really requires a harder build around to really shine, but it was very cool seeing it come out with [[Vivien, Champion of the Wilds]]. Neither of these cards get picked often, but I still really like them for the way they can totally change your game plan.

## Courser of Kruphix

[[Courser of Kruphix]] was, as expected, pretty hard to deal with. Four toughness is a hard barrier to cross in this cube, as there aren't a lot of things that will trade in combat and it outlives most burn spells as well. This card is an aggro killer. [[Auger of Autumn]] might be a better option here, especially now that I've chopped [[Setessan Champion]] for being too narrow.

## Gruff Triplets

Such a swingy card, still. I had said several drafts ago that I was going to replace this one, and I still think I will. The problem with [[Gruff Triplets]] is that he's a win-in-a-can. You can go from no board presence, 5 life, to winning in two turns with very little that can be done about it unless your opponent has the perfect hand (board wipe, or several bounce / flicker spells and a removal spell). I have my eyes on [[Esika's Chariot]] as one potential replacement. I think my green finishers need to have some value in the face of removal, but [[Gruff Triplets]] goes too far.
