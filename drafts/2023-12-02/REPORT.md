### Cards that played well

These are mostly from my own deck or decks that I played against or have first-hand experience with from this draft:

>>> <<[[!Moon-Circuit Hacker]][[!Fungal Infection]][[!Call of the Herd]][[!Phoenix Chick]]>> <<<


- [[Fungal Infection]] - was great in the aggro deck. Consistently removed blockers and generated a body.
- [[Phoenix Chick]] - was even recurred from the graveyard, really enjoyed seeing this one succeed.
- [[Call of the Herd]] - Solid bodies. Exactly what green was missing. Very happy with the value provided here, even without seeing it in a GY synergy deck yet.
- [[Moon-Circuit Hacker]] - First time seeing play, and a lot of generated value.

>>> <<[[!Mosswood Dreadknight]][[!Fearless Fledgling]][[!Kor Skyfisher]][[!Faerie Dreamthief]]>> <<<

- [[Mosswood Dreadknight]] - good body, recurring, improved deck consistency.
- [[Fearless Fledgling]] - got big as expected. Not always having flying was confusing, as expected.
- [[Kor Skyfisher]] - continues to shine as a synergy piece / enabler. Returns cycling lands, returns ETB threats like [[The Wandering Emperor]], etc.
- [[Faerie Dreamthief]] - Good card selection / advantage. Will work well in the aggro deck also when it comes together.

>>> <<[[!The Wandering Emperor]][[!Angel of Salvation]][[!Snapcaster Mage]][[!Titania, Protector of Argoth]]>> <<<

- [[The Wandering Emperor]] - surprisingly didn't feel overwhelming, but still pushing power level a bit.
- [[Angel of Salvation]] - First time she showed up in a while, but was very impactful and felt fair. Flash / convoke combination is fun.
- [[Snapcaster Mage]] - First time seeing play, wasn't overwhelming but did win a very close game.
- [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] - I need to not forget about her ETB. Otherwise solid. Usually assures value due to an immediate fetch.

>>> <<[[!Scavenging Ooze]][[!Eternal Witness]][[!Empty the Warrens]][[!Inexorable Blog]]>> <<<

- [[Scavenging Ooze]] - Life gain was key in the aggro matchup in a way [[Lion Sash]] would not have helped.
- [[Eternal Witness]] - I just feel safe when I have this card in my hand.
- [[Empty the Warrens]] - Always surprises me. In the right deck, this is pumping out 4-12 tokens even without any other storm support. It's not as aggressive as other token generators, more a control payoff.
- [[Inexorable Blob]] - I didn't have a perfect delirium deck, but he still managed to be a solid threat that was fun to play with / build around. First time trying delirium in the cube and I enjoyed the challenge.

### Cards to watch

These are mostly from my own deck or decks that I played against or have first-hand experience with from this draft:

>>> <<[[!Dark Confidant]][[!Nobilis of War]][[!Glory of Warfare]][[!Gruff Triplets]]>> <<<


- [[Dark Confidant]] is really powerful and might need to come out. BR aggro could use some more card draw though, and I like the deck-building constraint that confidant puts on the drafter. I am thinking I should add another 1-2 impulsive draw abilities to red, as well as perhaps a bit more scry, and look again at the RB lands. I may also try out [[Blood Scrivener]] in this spot for a similar but less potent ability. The thing is, [[Dark Confidant]] is a huge draft-time signal for aggro that I am hesitant to lose. It really impacts draft time decision making, even if when it hits the field it's a bit of a power outlier. I think it deserves a few more test runs to see how it impacts the environment before cutting it.
- Not so much an individual card, but there's some amount of "goodstuff piles" showing up. TBD how successful those decks are, but I think cards like [[Nobilis of War]], [[Glory of Warfare]] and similarly powerful gold cards that come without a big enough deck-building cost encourage this style of deck. I am not against supporting "goodstuff" decks in general, but like the tightly-crafted synergy decks, I want to make sure they are balanced and only show up occasionally. So, something to keep an eye on. I did enjoy the synergies between the Boros gold cards and Gruul cards such as [[Rubblebelt Rioters]], though. One or both of those Boros cards may be on the chopping block to pull in more fetches, or "power matters" cards that require a bit more build-around.
- [[Gruff Triplets]] were always going to be powerful. They have won all games they have been cast so far, this time beating a deck with both [[Wrath of God]] and [[Day of Judgment]] in it - two of the best answers available. Considering I am also trying to drop the average mana value of the cube, these guys seem like their time is short. The battle bewteen [[Gruff Triplets]] and [[Multani, Yavamaya's Avatar]] comes closer to an end. I may cut both - the more I lower the mana value of the cube, the more I enjoy the gameplay. [[Esika's Chariot]] fills a similar role as a midrange top-end that is hard to remove, but at a lower cost and with less of a "bomb" impact on the game.

>>> <<[[!Reckless Rage]][[!Severed Strands]][[!Dark Ritual]]>> <<<

- [[Reckless Rage]]. I finally witnessed the failure case of not having a creature in play, and it felt bad. Would much rather have a [[Thrill of Possibility]], [[Forked Bolt]], etc. here.
- [[Severed Strands]] for much the same reason - it's useless if you have no board, and that's often when you really need a removal spell.
- [[Dark Ritual]] is too often a dead draw in the late game, and can be pretty swingy early game. Either you out-resource your opponent to great effect, or you go down a card and effectively two-for-one yourself when your threat is removed. It's a classic card and I love that, but with so many more interesting effects in demand this one might not meet the bar any more.

### Notes from the draft (in no particular order)

My recent tweaks to removal definitely helped aggro in my matchup, which is great! It's not desirable trading life or tempo in these matchups. Usually I feel pretty good about casting [[Spider Food]] or [[Ulcerate]] in my midrange deck, but it's a sad moment casting it against [[Phoenix Chick]] for a sizable tempo / life loss. [[Ulcerate]] felt _really_ bad when playing against aggro. I think this is a good thing - it's the type of tension I was trying to add and that wouldn't exist if aggro wasn't supported well enough. I want most removal spells to be better in some matchups and worse in others, rather than generically good in order to force decision making and make sure the right removal finds the drafter who needs it. Need to see how [[Ulcerate]] handles in other matchups.

I really enjoy the higher land density. When the draft is over and it comes time to deck-build, it means way more of my drafted cards are actually playable. I will likely add more.

There's a small power-matters theme emerging from the set with cards like [[Dreadhorde Butcher]], [[Marshal's Anthem]], [[Dreadhorde Arcanist]], [[Rubblebelt Rioters]], [[Domri's Ambush]], [[Krenko, Tin Street Kingpin]], [[Domri, Anarch of Bolas]], and [[Ignoble Hierarch]] that can either synergize with +1/+1 counters, equipment, and abilities like _exalted_, or go-wide strategies like tokens and sacrifice. I like this incremental build rather than a "greater than power X" model. While I'm likely pulling [[Glory of Warfare]] for being a bit boring, I think cards like [[Qasali Pridemage]] fit nicely here - the payoff isn't as high, but it's cheaper, provides flexibility through interaction with artifacts and enchantments, and presents interesting game-time decisions. I had previously been off of exalted as an ability due to the tension it introduces in some board states, but I think combined with some of the above cards it actually provides some pretty interesting choices. [[Ignoble Hierarch]] into [[Qasali Pridemage]] into [[Krenko, Tin Street Kingpin]] would be very cool.

Strongly considering breaking singleton and going double-fetch lands to increase availability. I ended up having enough for my Titania deck, but a few more would have been better. They fuel all sorts of synergies I care about - _delerium_, _sacrifice_, _delve_. [[Worm Harvest]], [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]], [[Knight of the Reliquary]], [[Grim Discovery]], [[Dragon's Rage Channeler]], [[Treasure Cruise]] etc. More horizon lands besides the ones already there feel like a great option for similar reasons, also mixing well with draw-twice synercies. If only they were a full cycle - Rakdos especially could use one.

The spells-matter deck is loaded with Planeswalker options. Chandra, Saheeli, Jace, and Ral. We really don't need so many of them. I think to start, [[Ral, Storm Conduit]] is on the chopping block. He's probably my favorite of the bunch as far as power-level and abilities, but he's also the most narrow - only working in a deck running both blue AND red, whereas the others can all find themselves in a variety of decks. Least likely to cut is [[Saheeli, Sublime Artificer]] who is such a fun card promoting a diverse set of synergies - tokens, artifacts, spells - and fitting in any deck that runs blue _or_ red due to the hybrid cost.

Lands are an area of limited interaction. Cards like [[Restless Vinestalk]] and [[Maze of Ith]] are especially powerful because they are hard for your opponent to interact with. I think some small amount of additional land-interaction is probably a good thing to make these cards less of a sure-thing. As a general principal, I think there should be options to interact with all card types in all zones of the game. I do want some types / zones (lands, graveyard) to be _harder_ to interact with, but not impossible. The cube already has a few options for lands - [[Field of Ruin]], [[Acidic Slime]], [[Boseiju, Who Endures]] - but a handful of other options would be nice - especially if they can be added without being too narrow / parasitic. [[Rishadan Port]] is a good example of a card that would shine against [[Maze of Ith]], but is also just generically viable for resource denial. [[Wasteland]] might be too strong for my cube, but would seriously buff aggro decks who don't need the mana as much as they want to deny their opponent of it.
