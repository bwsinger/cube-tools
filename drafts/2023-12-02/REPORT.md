# Notes

- [[Dark Confidant]] is too poewrful and needs to come out. BR aggro could use some more card draw though. I am thinking I should add another 1-2 impulsive draw abilities to red, as well as perhaps a bit more scry, and look again at the RB lands.
- Finally got to see [[Mosswood Dreadknight]] get some real playing time, and he was great. Not too powerful but a solid little card advantage engine.
