### Cards that played well

These are mostly from my own deck or decks that I played against or have first-hand experience with:

- [[Fungal Infection]]
- [[Phoenix Chick]]
- [[Mosswood Dreadknight]]
- [[Fearless Fledgling]]
- [[Kor Skyfisher]]
- [[The Wandering Emperor]]
- [[Faerie Dreamthief]]
- [[Scavenging Ooze]]
- [[Eternal Witness]]
- [[Call of the Herd]]
- [[Angel of Salvation]]
- [[Empty the Warrens]]
- [[Snapcaster Mage]]
- [[Moon-Circuit Hacker]]
- [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]]

### Cards that may have issues

These are mostly from my own deck or decks that I played against and have first-hand experience with:

- [[Dark Confidant]] is powerful and might need to come out. BR aggro could use some more card draw though, and I like the deck-building constraint that confidant puts on the drafter. I am thinking I should add another 1-2 impulsive draw abilities to red, as well as perhaps a bit more scry, and look again at the RB lands. I may also try out [[Blood Scrivener]] in this spot for a similar but less potent ability.
- [[Ulcerate]] felt _really_ bad when playing against aggro. Need to see how it handles in other matchups.

### Notes

My recent tweaks to removal definitely helped aggro in my matchup - it's not great trading life or tempo in these matchups. Usually I feel pretty good about casting [[Spider Food]] or [[Ulcerate]] in my midrange deck, but it's a sad moment casting it against [[Phoenix Chick]] for a sizable tempo / life loss.
