## Draft report 12/02/2023

### Cards that played well

These are mostly from my own deck or decks that I played against or have first-hand experience with from this draft:

- [[Fungal Infection]] - was great in the aggro deck. Consistently removed blockers and generated a body.
- [[Phoenix Chick]] - was even recurred from the graveyard, really enjoyed seeing this one succeed.
- [[Mosswood Dreadknight]] - good body, recurring, improved deck consistency.
- [[Fearless Fledgling]] - got big as expected. Not always having flying was confusing, as expected.
- [[Kor Skyfisher]] - continues to shine as a synergy piece / enabler. Returns cycling lands, returns ETB threats like [[The Wandering Emperor]], etc.
- [[The Wandering Emperor]] - surprisingly didn't feel overwhelming, but still pushing power level a bit.
- [[Faerie Dreamthief]] - Good card selection / advantage. Will work well in the aggro deck also when it comes together.
- [[Scavenging Ooze]] - Life gain was key in the aggro matchup in a way [[Lion Sash]] would not have helped.
- [[Eternal Witness]] - I just feel safe when I have this card in my hand.
- [[Call of the Herd]] - Solid bodies. Exactly what green was missing. Very happy with the value provided here, even without seeing it in a GY synergy deck yet.
- [[Angel of Salvation]] - First time she showed up in a while, but was very impactful and felt fair. Flash / convoke combination is fun.
- [[Empty the Warrens]] - Always surprises me. In the right deck, this is pumping out 4-12 tokens even without any other storm support. It's not an aggro card like other token generators, rather it's a control payoff.
- [[Snapcaster Mage]] - First time seeing play, wasn't overwhelming but did win a very close game.
- [[Moon-Circuit Hacker]] - First time seeing play, and a lot of generated value.
- [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] - I need to not forget about her ETB. Otherwise solid. Usually earns her value due to an immediate fetch.

### Cards to watch

These are mostly from my own deck or decks that I played against or have first-hand experience with from this draft:

- [[Dark Confidant]] is powerful and might need to come out. BR aggro could use some more card draw though, and I like the deck-building constraint that confidant puts on the drafter. I am thinking I should add another 1-2 impulsive draw abilities to red, as well as perhaps a bit more scry, and look again at the RB lands. I may also try out [[Blood Scrivener]] in this spot for a similar but less potent ability. The thing is, [[Dark Confidant]] is a huge draft-time signal for aggro that I am hesitant to lose. It really impacts draft time decision making, even if when it hits the field it's a bit of a power outlier. I think it deserves a few more test runs to see how it impacts the environment before cutting it.
- [[Ulcerate]] felt _really_ bad when playing against aggro. I think this is a good thing - I want each removal spell to be better in some matchups and worse in others, rather than generically good. Need to see how [[Ulcerate]] handles in other matchups.
- Not so much an individual card, but there's some amount of "goodstuff piles" showing up. TBD how successful those decks are, but I think cards like [[Nobilis of War]], [[Glory of Warfare]] and similarly powerful gold cards that come without a big enough deck-building cost encourage this style of deck. I am not against supporting "goodstuff" decks in general, but I think the should be at a disadvantage against a really tightly-crafted synergy deck. So, something to keep an eye on. I did enjoy the synergies with the Gruul cards such as [[Rubblebelt Rioters]], though. One or both of those Boros cards may be on the chopping block to pull in other more narrow gold cards (or even just more lands) I've had my eye on, such as [[Akiri, Fearless Voyager]] and [[Hero of the Nyxborn]]. Decidedly lower floors on these cards, but the ceiling has potential to be pushed a bit.

### Notes from the draft

My recent tweaks to removal definitely helped aggro in my matchup, which is great! It's not desirable trading life or tempo in these matchups. Usually I feel pretty good about casting [[Spider Food]] or [[Ulcerate]] in my midrange deck, but it's a sad moment casting it against [[Phoenix Chick]] for a sizable tempo / life loss.

Feels like we might want one or two more black removal spells.

I really enjoy the higher land density. When the draft is over and it comes time to deck-build, it means way more of my drafted cards are actually playable. I will likely add more.

Strongly considering breaking singleton and going double-fetch lands to increase availability. I ended up having enough for my Titania deck, but a few more would have been better. They fuel all sorts of synergies I care about - _delerium_, _sacrifice_, _delve_. [[Worm Harvest]], [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]], [[Knight of the Reliquary]], [[Grim Discovery]], [[Dragon's Rage Channeler]], [[Treasure Cruise]] etc. More horizon lands besides the ones already there feel like a great option for similar reasons, also mixing well with draw-twice synercies. If only they were a full cycle - Rakdos especially could use one.

The spells-matter deck is loaded with Planeswalker options. Chandra, Saheeli, Jace, and Ral. We really don't need so many of them. I think to start, [[Ral, Storm Conduit]] is on the chopping block. He's probably my favorite of the bunch as far as power-level and abilities, but he's also the most narrow - only working in an Izzet deck, whereas the others can all find themselves in a variety of decks. Least likely to cut is [[Saheeli, Sublime Artificer]] who is such a fun card promoting a diverse set of synergies - tokens, artifacts, spells - and fitting in any deck that runs blue _or_ red due to the hybrid cost.
