This draft was a bit atypical, in that it involved some "three for all" matches as well
as a 2v2. I am treating a three-player victory as 2 wins, in order to keep a zero-sum win/lose ratio.

This does have a slight side-effect of increasing the importance of winning a three player game, but
in the long run I think it's more valuable to keep zero-sum than to have exact weights on wins.

Three player games:

Game 1: Xander wins 2, Dom and Casey lose 1
Game 2: Casey wins 2, Dom and Xander lose 1
Game 3: Xander wins 2, Dom and Casey lose 1

2v2:

Game 1: Paul wins, Xander wins
Game 2: Paul loses, Xander loses

Total:

Xander: 5 - 2
Casey: 3 - 3
Paul: 1 - 1
Dom: 1 - 4
